**ABSTRACT**

At present, many companies market home automation systems that are ready
to use, butwith the defect of being external to the home where they are installed,
compromising the security of the home’s inhabitants.
To solve this problem, this Final Degree project develops a fully functional
home automation system within a network. For this purpose, a web system, a
web client, and a software for devices based on the ESP8266 processor have been
developed, connecting the deviceswith theweb server based on “Api rest” architecture,
by means of a MQTT server.
The final architecture of the system is consolidated by two large systems, the
web system and the Iot devices system. The web system is packaged using docker,
which will allow an easy deployment of the system, and the intelligent devices
will have a multi-device software, that is, the same software contains the
different types of configurations existing in the system.
Finally, we will obtain a complete system that will allow the society to have a
private home automation software, free and easy to install and use.
